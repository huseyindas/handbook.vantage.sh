## Summary

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute.


## Pricing Dimensions

|Number of requests|You are charged $0.20 per 1M requests to your Lambda functions.|
|Duration of request|The price for duration depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. You can allocate any amount of memory to your function between 128MB and 10,240MB, in 1MB increments.|
